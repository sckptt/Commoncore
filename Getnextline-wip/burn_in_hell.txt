1. You're gonna burn in hell
2. Oh, burn in hell
3. You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
4. Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
5. Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned
6. To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn
7. Before I burn in hell
8. Oh, burn in hell
9. Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see?
10. It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
11. It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
12. Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
13. And then you'll burn in hell
14. Hear no evil, don't you
15. See no evil, don't you
16. Oh, burn in hell
17. Lay no evil down on me
18. You're gonna burn in hell
19. Speak no evil, don't you
20. Think no evil, don't you
21. Oh, burn in hell
22. Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
