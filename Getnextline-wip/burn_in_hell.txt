You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn
Before I burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
And then you'll burn in hell
Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
Oh, burn in hell
Lay no evil down on me
You're gonna burn in hell
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Oh, burn in hell
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
